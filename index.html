										<h2>Hello World!</h2>
										<p>Welcome to the hompage of Jonathan Waring</p>
									</header>
									<p>I'm currently a Master of Science candidate at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health studying Health Data Science. I recently graduated from the University of Georgia with a B.S. in Computer Science, along with a minor in Public Health and a certificate in Applied Data Science. </p>
									<p> My inquisitive nature and desire to find logical reasoning and causation for the way things are immediately drew me to the field of data science and how it combines statistics and programming to find underlying patterns in data. For me, applying data science to healthcare in order to help prevent the spread of infectious disease, improve health outcomes, and analyze trends in the healthcare industry that affects the well-being of everyone is what makes it exciting. </p>

													<h4>Automated Sarcasm Detection of Reddit Comments</h4>
													<p>Sarcasm is a nuanced form of language in which the author is attempting to convey the opposite of what is actually stated. Given its inherent ambiguity, sarcasm detection has been a challenging task for humans and computers alike. We attempt to develop a machine learning strategy using natural language processing (NLP) techniques in order to identify sarcasm in Reddit comments. Experimental results on the SARC dataset shows that by combining lexical and word embedding features, our best performing model achieves a testing accuracy of 61.24% and a F1 score of 0.605</p>

													<h4>Identification of Vaccine Misinformation Online</h4>
													<p>While the effectiveness and safety of vaccines has been widely studied and verified, there is still opposition from the anti-vaccine movement and it has led to vaccine hesitancy. It is an ever-growing and constantly changing problem that needs constant surveillance. The Internet plays a large role in disseminating vaccine misinformation to a large number of people, which contributes to the vaccine hesitancy problem. In order to combat the spread of misinformation online, it is important to first recognize true facts from false ones. We attempt to develop a machine learning strategy using natural language processing (NLP) that allows one to identify misinformation in vaccine-related webpages. This will be accomplished through the use of the low-dimensional document embedding algorithm, Doc2Vec and the use of semi-supervised learning techniques.</p>

													<h4>Epidemiological Data: Parameter Estimation and Pitfalls</h4>
													<p>During an outbreak, epidemiologically important parameters need to be quantified and estimated to better understand and potentially put in place timely response strategies. These include quantities such as the mean infectious period and the transmission potential of the pathogen. Fitting transmission models to incidence reports has become a standard way of attaining quick real-time estimates of these parameters. Cumulative incidence data (total number of infections to date) is often used rather than raw incidence (number of new cases in a defined reporting period). Evidence suggest this choice can critically affect our perception of the variability in parameters and hence the uncertainty in predictions. This project focuses on further elaborating on this problem using simulated epidemic data.</p>

Some of the work published here was originally published during my time as an undergraduate student at the University of Georgia on <a href="https://athensscienceobserver.com/">The Athens Science Observer</a>. If you have some time, please check out their website and see some of their work. Also, keep in mind while reading these blogs that I am just one person: not statisically significant nor representative (little statistics humor for ya). </p>

													<h4>Computers Detecting Sarcasm? Great!</h4>
													<p>Sarcasm can be pretty ambiguous which makes it hard even for humans to detect if a comment is sarcastic or not. If you think that humans have a hard time detecting sarcasm, imagine how difficult it must be for computers</p>
