										<h2>Hello World!</h2>
										<p>Welcome to the hompage of Jonathan Waring</p>
									</header>
									<p>I'm currently a Master of Science candidate at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health studying Health Data Science. I recently graduated from the University of Georgia with a B.S. in Computer Science, along with a minor in Public Health and a certificate in Applied Data Science. </p>
									<p> My inquisitive nature and desire to find logical reasoning and causation for the way things are immediately drew me to the field of data science and how it combines statistics and programming to find underlying patterns in data. For me, applying data science to healthcare in order to help prevent the spread of infectious disease, improve health outcomes, and analyze trends in the healthcare industry that affects the well-being of everyone is what makes it exciting. </p>

										<h3>Some Stuff I've Done</h3>

													<h4>Predicting Hospital Readimission</h4>
													<p>In this project, we attempt to develop a machine learning strategy that allows one to predict 30 day hospital readmission of diabetes patients using electronic health record data?</p>
													<p>This project was done in collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/selenashuang/">Selena Huang</a>,  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericaannmoreira/">Erica Moreira</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-rosenthal/">Jacob Rosenthal</a> as a final project for BST 260 (Data Science I) at Harvard's T.H.

													<h4>Automated Sarcasm Detection of Reddit Comments</h4>
													<p>In this project, we attempt to develop a machine learning strategy using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify sarcasm in Reddit comments. Experimental results on the SARC dataset shows that by combining lexical and word embedding features, our best performing model achieves a testing accuracy of 61.24% and a F1 score of 0.605.</p>

													<h4>Identification of Vaccine Misinformation Online</h4>
													<p>The Internet plays a large role in disseminating vaccine misinformation to a large number of people, which contributes to the vaccine hesitancy problem. I attempt to develop a machine learning strategy using natural language processing (NLP) that allows one to identify misinformation in vaccine-related webpages. This was accomplished through the use of the low-dimensional document embedding algorithm, Doc2Vec, and the use of semi-supervised learning techniques.</p>
													<p>This project was conducted under the direction of <a href="https://quinngroup.github.io/people.html">Dr. Shannon Quinn</a> as a CURO research project at the Univerity of Gerogia. </p>

												<div class="inner">
													<h4>Epidemiological Data: Parameter Estimation and Pitfalls</h4>
													<p>During an outbreak, epidemiologically important parameters need to be quantified and estimated to better understand and potentially put in place timely response strategies. These include quantities such as the mean infectious period and the transmission potential of the pathogen. Fitting transmission models to incidence reports has become a standard way of attaining quick real-time estimates of these parameters. Cumulative incidence data (total number of infections to date) is often used rather than raw incidence (number of new cases in a defined reporting period). Evidence suggest this choice can critically affect our perception of the variability in parameters and hence the uncertainty in predictions. This project focuses on further elaborating on this problem using simulated epidemic data.</p>
													<p>This project was conducted under the direction of <a href="http://rohanilab.ecology.uga.edu/people/">Dr. Pejman Rohani and Dr. Ana Bento</a> as a National Science Foundation REU project at UGA's Population Biology of Infectious Diseases REU site. </p>

										<h3>Blog</h3>
										<p>Want to hear some of my thoughts? Want to check out my science communication skills in action? Then you have come to the right place. Some of the work published here was originally published during my time as an undergraduate student at the University of Georgia on <a href="https://athensscienceobserver.com/">The Athens Science Observer</a>.

													<h4>Effectiveness of Vaccines</h4>
													<p>Despite the effectiveness of vaccines being established for years, there is still some controversy about their safety and effectiveness. Using data, we can see that vaccines do appear to be effective and that their link to autism is unfounded.</p>
